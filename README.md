# Housing-Price-Prediction
Code for building a machine Learning Model to predict the houses prices.



Here, I have used Regression techniques - which measures the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

Have used kaggel- Banglore house price dataset for building model

For development of my project I have used
python programming language
libraries - pandas,numpy,matplotlib,sklearn,seaborne
for development have used jupyter notebook

Flow of the project - 
1.	Import Libraries
2.	Load Dataset
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis
4.	Data Cleaning
5.	Feature Engineering
6.	Outlier Removal using Business Logic
7.	Outlier Removal using Standard Deviation & Mean
8.	Data Visualization
9.	Make All Columns Numeric Type
10.	Split the Data into Train and Test 
11.	Building a Model
12.	Test the Model for few properties



conclusion:
1.	We found that Linear Regression fits our dataset and gives the accuracy of 87.42%. 
2.	Ridge Regression gives the accuracy of 87.51%. 
3.	Random Forest Regression gives an accuracy of 84.99%.
