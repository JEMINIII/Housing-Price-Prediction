# Housing-Price-Prediction
Code for building a machine Learning Model to predict the houses prices.

Here, I have used Regression techniques - which measures the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

Have used kaggel- Banglore house price dataset for building model
For development of my project I have used

Flow of the project - 
1.	Import Libraries
2.	Load Dataset
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis
4.	Data Cleaning
5.	Feature Engineering
6.	Outlier Removal using Business Logic
7.	Outlier Removal using Standard Deviation & Mean
8.	Data Visualization
9.	Make All Columns Numeric Type
10.	Split the Data into Train and Test 
11.	Building a Model
12.	Test the Model for few properties


hear are some visualizations

â€¢	This analysed feature set was given as an input to machine learning algorithms and calculated the performance of each model to compare based on Accuracy score. 

1.	We found that Linear Regression fits our dataset and gives the accuracy of 87.42%. 
2.	Ridge Regression gives the accuracy of 87.51%. 
3.	Random Forest Regression gives an accuracy of 84.99%.


Now, let's see the test results
